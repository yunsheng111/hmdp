**Meeting Record**
* **Date & Time:** [2024-05-29 10:00:00 +08:00]
* **Meeting Type:** Task Kickoff & Initial Analysis (Simulated)
* **Chair:** PM
* **Recorder:** DW
* **Attendees:** PM, PDM, AR, LD, TE, SE, DW
* **Agenda Overview:**
    1. Understand user request: Implement admin login backend.
    2. Review provided materials: `hmdp.sql`, `Admin.java`, `管理员功能模块接口设计.md`.
    3. Initial assessment of database design implications.
    4. Define scope for RESEARCH mode.
* **Discussion Points:**
    * PM: "User wants admin login backend, with attention to DB design. Existing `hmdp.sql` seems to cover admin tables."
    * PDM: "API spec `管理员功能模块接口设计.md` clearly defines login request/response, including returning token and admin info (id, username, roles, avatar)."
    * AR: "DB schema (`tb_admin_user`, `tb_admin_role`, `tb_admin_user_role`) supports RBAC. Sa-Token is specified for auth. Password storage is hashed. `Admin.java` entity seems mostly aligned with `tb_admin_user`."
    * LD: "We'll need a Controller, Service, and use the existing Mapper. Password checking will be crucial. Role retrieval logic needs to be implemented."
    * TE: "Test cases should include: valid login, invalid username, invalid password, disabled account, deleted account."
    * SE: "Focus on secure password handling (comparison, not exposure) and robust token generation."
* **Action Items/Decisions:**
    1. Proceed with RESEARCH mode to analyze provided files in detail.
    2. DW to update `AdminLoginTask.md` with initial findings.
* **DW Confirmation:** [Minutes complete and compliant with standards. Initial task file `AdminLoginTask.md` created.]

* **Meeting Type:** Solution Selection (INNOVATE - Simulated)
* **Chair:** PM
* **Recorder:** DW
* **Attendees:** PM, PDM, AR, LD, TE, SE, DW
* **Agenda Overview:**
    1. Review proposed solutions for admin login (Solution A, B, C).
    2. Discuss pros, cons, and alignment with user requirements.
    3. Select the optimal solution for implementation.
* **Discussion Points:**
    * AR: "Presented three solutions: A (Standard Secure), B (Enhanced Security & Configurable), C (Lightweight & Extensible). Details available in `/project_document/architecture/` (SolutionA_arch_v1.0.md, etc. - conceptual, final chosen one will be `admin_login_chosen_solution_arch_v1.0.md`)."
    * LD: "Solution B seems overkill for the initial request. A and C are more aligned. Combining A's security focus with C's structural clarity is a good path."
    * PDM: "User's core need is a functional and secure login. The API spec is clear. A straightforward, secure implementation that is also well-structured (like C promotes) is best."
    * TE: "Testing complexity for A and C is manageable and similar. B would add more test cases."
    * SE: "Solution A meets baseline security. If we structure it well (per C), future enhancements like those in B can be added more easily if needed."
    * PM: "Agreement seems to be forming around a hybrid: core security of A, with structural design of C."
* **Action Items/Decisions:**
    1. **Decision:** Proceed with a combined approach: **Solution A (Standard Secure Implementation) + Solution C (Code Structuring for Extensibility)**.
    2. AR to create/update the architecture document `project_document/architecture/admin_login_chosen_solution_arch_v1.0.md` to reflect this chosen integrated solution, including a sequence diagram and notes on service layer design.
    3. DW to update the main task file (`AdminLoginTask.md`) with the chosen solution details in the 'Proposed Solutions' section.
    4. Proceed to PLAN mode to detail the implementation steps based on this chosen solution.
* **DW Confirmation:** Minutes complete and compliant with standards. Chosen solution documented. [2024-05-29 10:35:00 +08:00]

* **Date & Time:** [2024-05-29 10:50:00 +08:00]
* **Meeting Type:** Implementation Planning (PLAN - Simulated)
* **Chair:** PM
* **Recorder:** DW
* **Attendees:** PM, PDM, AR, LD, TE, SE, DW
* **Agenda Overview:**
    1. Review chosen solution (Hybrid: Solution A - Standard Secure + Solution C - Extensible Structure).
    2. Decompose solution into detailed, actionable tasks for implementation.
    3. Define DTOs, Controller, Service, Mapper interactions.
    4. Plan Sa-Token integration, error handling, logging, and unit tests.
    5. Finalize implementation checklist.
* **Discussion Points:**
    * PM: "We are now in PLAN mode. Objective: create a granular, verifiable checklist for the admin login feature."
    * AR: "The plan must align with `admin_login_chosen_solution_arch_v1.0.md`. I will ensure details like password hashing, role retrieval, and Sa-Token usage are correctly planned at the component level, adhering to SOLID and KISS."
    * LD: "I'll break down the work into: DTO creation, Controller setup, Service interface and implementation (including core logic for validation, DB interaction, password check, role fetching, Sa-Token calls), and Mapper method definitions. Error handling and logging will be integrated. All code will follow core coding principles."
    * PDM: "The plan must ensure the API response (`AdminInfoDTO`) includes all fields specified in `管理员功能模块接口设计.md`: id, username, roles, avatar, token."
    * TE: "Each task in the checklist should have clear acceptance criteria to facilitate testing. I'll help define these and outline test points for key logic like password validation and role assignment."
    * SE: "Security considerations for password comparison (secure hash compare) and Sa-Token configuration need to be explicit in the service implementation task."
    * DW: "All plan details will be meticulously recorded in `AdminLoginTask.md` under 'Implementation Plan (PLAN)'. This meeting's minutes will be added to `team_collaboration_log.md`."
* **Action Items/Decisions:**
    1. **Decision:** The team collaboratively defined a 7-step implementation checklist (P3-DTO-001 to P3-TEST-001), covering DTOs, Controller, Service, Mapper, Sa-Token, Error Handling/Logging, and Unit Tests.
    2. AR to review and update `project_document/architecture/admin_login_chosen_solution_arch_v1.0.md` based on the detailed plan, including an update log entry.
    3. DW to update `AdminLoginTask.md` with the full implementation checklist and these meeting minutes.
    4. Prepare to present the detailed plan to the user via MCP.
* **DW Confirmation:** Minutes complete and compliant with standards. Implementation checklist prepared for documentation. [2024-05-29 10:50:00 +08:00]

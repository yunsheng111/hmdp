# Team Collaboration Log

---
**Meeting Record**
* **Date & Time:** [2024-05-29 10:00:00 +08:00]
* **Meeting Type:** Task Kickoff & Initial Analysis (Simulated)
* **Chair:** PM
* **Recorder:** DW
* **Attendees:** PM, PDM, AR, LD, TE, DW
* **Agenda Overview:** 
    1. Define task scope: Fan inbox read/unread feature design.
    2. Analyze existing code (`BlogServiceImpl.java`) for current implementation.
    3. Identify potential issues and areas for improvement.
    4. Discuss core requirements and user expectations for the feature.
* **Discussion Points:**
    * PDM: Highlighted that current unread count logic (`USER_UNREAD_COUNT_KEY` update in `queryBlogOfFollow`) is likely incorrect and not user-friendly. Stressed the need for accurate total unread count.
    * AR: Pointed out potential data inconsistency in `markBlogAsRead` if Redis operations are not atomic. Raised concerns about performance of fetching all read blog IDs for users with extensive read history. Suggested exploring alternative approaches for managing read status to optimize performance. Questioned the current design of `FEED_KEY` potentially mixing read/unread items before `markBlogAsRead` is called.
    * LD: Discussed the ambiguity of "read" trigger â€“ explicit vs. implicit (e.g., opening blog detail). Noted the complexity in `queryBlogOfFollow`'s offset calculation. Emphasized need for robust unread count maintenance (atomic operations).
    * TE: Outlined test scenarios including concurrency, data accuracy under various operations (new post, mark read, blog deletion by author), and boundary conditions. Specifically mentioned the need to test how blog deletion by the author affects follower inboxes and unread counts.
    * PM: Summarized that the current Redis-based approach has foundational elements but requires significant refinement for accuracy, consistency, and performance. Tasked the team with further investigation into these areas.
    * DW: Confirmed all points recorded and will update `FanInboxReadUnreadDesign.md` with the analysis.
* **Action Items/Decisions:**
    1. All team members to review `BlogServiceImpl.java` focusing on `FEED_KEY`, `BLOG_READ_KEY`, `USER_UNREAD_COUNT_KEY` interactions.
    2. AR and LD to investigate alternative Redis data structures or strategies for managing read status and unread counts more efficiently and accurately.
    3. PDM to define clear requirements for "read" event triggers and unread count display.
    4. DW to update the 'Analysis' section of `FanInboxReadUnreadDesign.md` with findings.
* **DW Confirmation:** [Minutes complete and compliant with standards. [2024-05-29 10:05:00 +08:00]]

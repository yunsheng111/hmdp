# 0. Team Collaboration Log & Key Decision Points (Located in D:/workspace/hmdp/project_document/team_collaboration_log.md or within this file, DW maintains, PM chairs meetings)
---
**Meeting Record**
* **Date & Time:** [2024-07-18 10:00:00 +08:00]
* **Meeting Type:** Task Kickoff/Requirements Clarification (Simulated)
* **Chair:** PM
* **Recorder:** DW
* **Attendees:** PM, PDM, AR, LD, DW
* **Agenda Overview:**
    1. Understand user request: Integrate Sa-Token and document the process.
    2. Define deliverables: An integration guide in the `.doc` folder.
    3. Initialize project documentation.
* **Discussion Points:**
    * PM: The primary goal is to provide a clear and actionable Sa-Token integration guide for the hmdp project.
    * PDM: The guide should be easy to follow for developers.
    * AR: We need to consider how Sa-Token fits into the existing hmdp architecture. This will be explored during the research phase.
    * LD: The guide should cover Maven dependencies, configuration, and basic usage examples relevant to a Spring Boot project.
    * DW: All findings and the final guide will be documented according to protocol. Task file and collaboration log initiated. The final guide will be placed in `D:/workspace/hmdp/.doc/SaToken_Integration_Guide.md`.
* **Action Items/Decisions:**
    1. AI to proceed with RESEARCH mode: Study Sa-Token documentation.
    2. AI to create the initial task file and team collaboration log.
    3. AI to prepare the final integration guide as specified.
* **DW Confirmation:** [Minutes complete and compliant with standards.]

# Task Description
阅读Sa-Token的官方文档，然后告诉我如何集成在项目中，结果整理在 @.doc 文件夹下. The target folder is `D:/workspace/hmdp/.doc`.

# Project Overview (Populated in RESEARCH or PLAN phase)
[Objectives, core features, users, value, success metrics (PM, PDM perspective)]
---
*The following sections are maintained by AI during protocol execution. DW is responsible for overall document quality. All referenced paths are relative to `D:/workspace/hmdp/project_document/` unless specified. All documents should include an update log section where applicable.*
---

# 1. Analysis (RESEARCH Mode Population)
* Requirements Clarification/Deep Dive (Refers to kickoff meeting log)
* Code/System Investigation (AR provides architectural analysis, relevant docs in `D:/workspace/hmdp/project_document/architecture/` with update logs)
* Technical Constraints & Challenges
* Implicit Assumptions
* Early Edge Case Considerations
* Preliminary Risk Assessment
* Knowledge Gaps
* **DW Confirmation:** This section is complete, clear, synced, and meets documentation standards.

# 2. Proposed Solutions (INNOVATE Mode Population)
* **Solution X: [Name]**
    * Core Idea & Mechanism
    * Architectural Design (AR led): [Architecture diagrams, key components, tech stack, etc., documented in `D:/workspace/hmdp/project_document/architecture/SolutionX_arch_v1.0.md` [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ], including version history and update log, reflecting core coding principles consideration]
    * Multi-Role Evaluation: Pros, Cons, Risks, Complexity/Cost
    * Innovation/First-Principles Application
    * Linkage to Research Findings
* **(Other Solutions B, C...)**
* **Solution Comparison & Decision Process:** [Comparison of key differences, rationale for preferred solution, reflecting internal debate. **Must include/link to relevant solution selection meeting minute summary from "Team Collaboration Log".**]
* **Final Preferred Solution:** [Solution X]
* **DW Confirmation:** This section is complete, decision process is traceable, synced, and meets documentation standards.

# 3. Implementation Plan (PLAN Mode Generation - Checklist Format)
[Atomic operations, IPO, acceptance criteria, test points, security notes, risk mitigation. AR ensures plan aligns with selected, documented architecture (e.g., `D:/workspace/hmdp/project_document/architecture/SolutionX_arch_vY.Z.md`)]
**Implementation Checklist:**
1.  `[P3-ROLE-NNN]` **Action:** [Description of architectural/development task]
    * Rationale, Inputs (referencing APIs/data structures/architectural decisions), Processing, Outputs, Acceptance Criteria, Risks/Mitigation, Test Points, Security Notes, (Optional) Est. Effort/Complexity
* **DW Confirmation:** Checklist is complete, detailed, unambiguous, synced, and meets documentation standards.

# 4. Current Execution Step (EXECUTE Mode - Updated when starting a step)
> `[MODE: EXECUTE-PREP][MODEL: YOUR_MODEL_NAME]` Preparing to execute: "`[Step Description]`"
> * **Mandatory Document Check & Accuracy Confirmation:** "I have meticulously reviewed [specific document versions, e.g., Implementation Plan v1.0, Architecture Diagram SolutionX_arch_vY.Z, etc.] in `D:/workspace/hmdp/project_document/`. **[If applicable: I have activated `context7-mcp` for comprehensive understanding of all related contexts.]** Confirmed consistency with all documented records."
> * Memory Review (Plan, APIs, AR Gguidelines, Data Models, etc., all retrieved from latest versions in `D:/workspace/hmdp/project_document/`)
> * **Code Structure Pre-computation & Optimization Thinking (incl. Core Coding Principle application):** (LD led, AR advises) **[If applicable: Activating `server-sequential-thinking` for complex logic planning.]**
> * Vulnerability/Defect Pre-check (SE concerns)
>
> `[MODE: EXECUTE][MODEL: YOUR_MODEL_NAME]` Executing: "`[Step Description]`"

# 5. Task Progress (EXECUTE Mode - Appended after each step/node)

# Frontend Structure (Nginx & Static Assets)

Frontend assets and Nginx configuration are located within the `hmdp-front/` directory.

## Key Components:

*   `hmdp-front/nginx-1.18.0/`: Contains the Nginx web server.
    *   `conf/nginx.conf`: The main Nginx configuration file. This file dictates how Nginx handles requests, serves static files, and potentially proxies requests to the backend.
    *   `html/hmdp/`: This is likely the root directory for the frontend application's static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images).
        *   `css/`: Stylesheets for the application.
        *   `imgs/`: Image assets used in the frontend.
        *   `js/`: JavaScript files for frontend logic.
*   `hmdp-front/logs/`: Logs generated by the Nginx server.
*   `hmdp-front/temp/`: Temporary files used by Nginx.

## Serving Frontend:

The Nginx server is configured to serve the static content from `hmdp-front/nginx-1.18.0/html/hmdp/`. Any dynamic API calls from the frontend are likely proxied by Nginx to the backend Java Spring Boot application.

Understanding the Nginx configuration in `nginx.conf` is crucial for debugging frontend loading issues or reverse proxy settings.

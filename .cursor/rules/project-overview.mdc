# Project Overview

This project, "hmdp" (presumably "黑马点评" - HeiMa DianPing), is a full-stack application.

## Key Directories:

*   `src/`: Contains the Java backend source code.
    *   See [backend-structure.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/backend-structure.mdc) for more details.
*   `hmdp-front/`: Contains the frontend assets, likely served by Nginx.
    *   See [frontend-structure.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/frontend-structure.mdc) for more details.
*   `pom.xml`: The [pom.xml](mdc:pom.xml) file is the Project Object Model for Maven, defining project dependencies, plugins, and build configurations for the Java backend.
*   `.doc/`: Likely contains project documentation.
*   `log/`: Likely contains application logs for the backend.

## Database:

*   Database schema and migration scripts might be located within `src/main/resources/db/`.
*   MyBatis mappers are located in `src/main/resources/mapper/`.

## Configuration:

*   Nginx configuration can be found in `hmdp-front/nginx-1.18.0/conf/`.
*   Spring Boot application properties are typically in `src/main/resources/application.yml` or `application.properties` (not explicitly listed but common).

This overview should help in navigating the primary components of the hmdp project.
